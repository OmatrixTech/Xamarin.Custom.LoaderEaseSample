A "wait loader" or "loading spinner" is a user interface element commonly used in software applications to indicate to users that a process is ongoing and that they should wait for it to complete. 
It serves several functions and meets specific requirements to enhance the user experience. Here's a breakdown of the functions and requirements of a wait loader:

### Functions:

1. **Visual Feedback:**
   - **Purpose:** Provide visual feedback to users that a process is in progress.
   - **Importance:** Users often appreciate knowing that their action has been acknowledged and that the application is actively working on their request.

2. **User Engagement:**
   - **Purpose:** Keep users engaged during potentially lengthy operations.
   - **Importance:** A loader prevents users from feeling like the application has frozen or become unresponsive. It assures them that something is happening in the background.

3. **Expectation Management:**
   - **Purpose:** Set clear expectations about the duration of the process.
   - **Importance:** Users are more likely to wait patiently if they have an idea of how long the process might take. A loader manages expectations and reduces perceived waiting time.

4. **Prevent User Interaction:**
   - **Purpose:** Disable or limit user interactions during the process.
   - **Importance:** Preventing user interactions while a process is ongoing helps avoid unexpected behavior or errors that could result from user input during that time.

5. **Progress Indication:**
   - **Purpose:** Communicate progress if the duration of the process is known.
   - **Importance:** For processes with a foreseeable duration, a loader can indicate progress, giving users a sense of how much work has been completed and how much is remaining.

### Requirements:

1. **Visibility Control:**
   - **Requirement:** The loader should be easily visible when active and hidden when the process is complete.
   - **Importance:** Users need to know when the application is actively processing their request and when it has completed the task.

2. **Clear Design:**
   - **Requirement:** The loader should have a clear and easily understandable design.
   - **Importance:** Users should quickly recognize the loader and understand its purpose without confusion.

3. **Performance:**
   - **Requirement:** The loader should not degrade overall application performance.
   - **Importance:** The loader itself should not contribute to increased loading times or negatively impact the application's responsiveness.

4. **Accessibility:**
   - **Requirement:** The loader should be accessible to users with disabilities.
   - **Importance:** Ensure that users who rely on assistive technologies can still understand that a process is ongoing.

5. **Configurability:**
   - **Requirement:** The loader should be configurable in terms of appearance and behavior.
   - **Importance:** Different parts of the application might have different loading requirements; hence, flexibility in configuring the loader is valuable.

6. **Consistency:**
   - **Requirement:** The loader should maintain a consistent appearance and behavior across the application.
   - **Importance:** Consistency helps users become familiar with the loading experience, fostering a more intuitive and predictable user interface.

Implementing a wait loader effectively requires consideration of these functions and requirements to create a positive user experience and maintain the usability of the application, especially during background processes or network requests.
